From the outset, Roti’s goal as a company has been so much more than being another “fast casual” food chain. Their mission statement - to serve food that “loves you back” - has been woven into nearly all aspects of how they service their customers. From highly customizable entree combinations to wholesomely sourced ingredients, Roti prides itself on being ahead of the curb. One of the less common ways they stay ahead of that curb is by being a data-oriented company behind the scenes. By following their data to drive their decision-making, Roti has been able to thrive in the fast-growing and often changing hospitality industry.

Since embracing the potential of being data-driven, Roti has become an example of how restaurants can use insight and technology to better serve their customers. With a lift from the Keboola platform, Roti is able to ask better questions, analyze customer preferences, and get a competitive advantage against other restaurant chains. To find out why they chose Keboola and how they use our tools, we turned to Jeff Miller, VP of Technology at Roti.

Jeff has a long history of combining his passion for technology and innovation at the intersection of customer experience and business. Before Roti, he was Director of Technology Innovation & Seed Stores at McDonald’s. Jeff takes relevant technology innovations and applies them in the food industry. For him, it is the new normal.

**Jeff, can you please tell us what were the first challenges you had to deal with when you stepped into ROTI?**

With the old system, we were not able to identify the insights that were necessary to drive better action. We needed to improve communication across all levels and listen to the signals that could, with focused investment, create the biggest change for us and identify the measures that were most impactful for us.

**And that was possible only with today’s technology?**

Absolutely. Technology nowadays is really around the insights in the culture and the innovation that you can bring from a differentiation perspective, free from a brand. It’s definitely nothing like twenty years ago when you had only desktop support, broken networks, all the bits and bytes, etc. We are at a different level today.

  
**What was the original business objective of your cooperation with Keboola?**

At the very beginning, we needed to capture customers‘ feedback and put it all into a single spot. Only this way can we understand how the feedback is influenced by location, people, and experience. Thanks to Keboola, we’ve got business insights. We enabled people to take that feedback from a corporate level and act upon it at the restaurant level.

  
**Nowadays you use Keboola as a data hub for all your data. Why did you decide to do so? Can you describe what data management looked like at Roti before you started using Keboola?**

To compete these days, we don‘t want to just analyze and react. We need to anticipate and act. Keboola as a data hub has accelerated us closer to our future vision. I’ve got data that is stuck in artificial silos, and I need to create insights that my business partners are asking for at the senior leader level. We needed to go from nothing to something really quickly. Our previous data management sounds like from a different world today – Excel and email.

**You combine Keboola with Looker. What are the major benefits of using the Keboola/Looker stack?**

Keboola’s Business Data Model (BDM) is a critical differentiator in the space. It allows us to map out the flow of our business data to easily answer current and future business questions (agnostic to the source of the data required to generate insights and action). As for Looker, it‘s really the usability. It‘s the flexibility and scalability, and the power that it puts in the hands of my team and our power users on the business side. Technology is becoming the language of the business.

**What were the main pain points which made you think about changing the previous way of working with data?**

First of all, it took forever to get answers to critical business questions. And you can‘t survive very long with that in this fast growing field. Second, Excel was our primary data platform. And third, we really suffered from the lack of transparency to provide insights. Let’s say it plainly: I don’t care about data. What I care about is the whole journey from data to insights and taking actions on those insights. I want to make it accessible to all people in the organization across all departments, at all times, and from different points of view.

**Who are the users and who are the consumers of Keboola at Roti?**

Leadership, above and in the restaurants. People that need to know the answers for questions that are being asked and queried at the board level. They don’t care about the servers that data is stored in. They want to be able to ask a question and get an answer that is insight driven.

**What are your future plans when it comes to BI/data management?**

The plan is to build up our last year’s model “From Data to Insights”. This and the next year, we want to start to use the “From Insights to Action“ model.

**What do you think will be the next evolutionary step for a data-driven organization?**

Machine learning and AI. The insights are kind of becoming the machine-driven part. A machine is getting smarter and smarter by listening and learning about how your restaurant is performing. It will eventually get smart enough to recognize that a restaurant in an urban area has different performance than a restaurant in a suburban area. And that’s the power that I see – the machine is always listening, learning and evolving.

  
**A Breakdown of Roti’s Wins With Keboola  
**We at Keboola have been proud and excited to help Roti reach the next level in their mission - through the power of data. Since bringing Keboola on, we’ve helped Roti achieve the following:

* Shaving off nearly 4 hours of manual work per employee through automation.


* Linking data insights with the Sales team for improved business relations.
* Giving employees at the General Management level access to performance analytics on sales and labor.
* Helped Roti customers connect with the brand digitally through feedback surveys, and quantified that feedback for analysis.
* Democratized data within the entire organization, allowing for the hiring of a Data Engineer and Director of Product.
* Through automation, reduced hours of the finance team from 4-6 all the way down to zero.
* Created access to performance data for the Operations team, which uses it on a daily basis.
* Use data to create and analyze a labor schedule, find areas for improvement, and ultimately create opportunities for new employment.
* Roti partnered with a University to create more data around student employment and labor, which Roti was able to use to create more student employment opportunities, as well as allow the University to process the data for its students.

Before tapping into the potential of their data, Roti was simply making the best decisions based on word of mouth, employee feedback and customer feedback. While these are all obviously still important, Keboola was able to help Roti quantify all of this information into usable data that Roti has said boosted and improved the business as a whole. The difference between a good restaurant and a bad restaurant is that a good restaurant is going to do everything it can to reach its true potential. We at Keboola deeply admire Roti’s business and have been so excited to see them successfully implement our product for the betterment of the entire organization.
