In publishing and graphic design, **lorem ipsum** is common placeholder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation, such as **web pages**, typography, and **graphical layout**. It is a form of "greeking".

Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. "Lorem ipsum" also approximates a typical distribution of letters in English.
