  desc: <p>Before we started working with Keboola we had over 20 systems internally
    and externally that we wanted to analyze data for better business decissions and
    take actions based on those insights.</p><p class="p1">We had dozens and dozens
    of xls spreadsheets and peopel spent hourse a day to manually retype, clean and
    report the data. It was never on time and never correct. We were not able to move
    ahead and become a technology leader as we had always wanted. Part of the reason
    was that we new from our McDonalds engagement how difficult it is to build an
    easy enough and intuitive infrastructure for all of your needs of integrating,
    cleaning and analyzing data. Even harder when you want the business people to
    use it and self serve analytics and we just didn’t have time and resources to
    do it. We thought it would take us years and millions of dollars to get the results.</p><p><img
    src="/uploads/quote-img.jpg"></p><p>After we engaged with Keboola’s platform we
    had our first project done in 3 days. All the data from user feedback was integrated,
    stored, cleaned and visualised so everybody saw the results immediately. The whole
    process was orchestrated to happen several times a day so we’ve always had fresh
    data from multiple sources together.</p><p class="p1">More over, Keboola 3rd party
    appstore allowed us to apply sofisticated ai techniques to our unstructured text
    with just one click! Now we don’t only se where things are happening and how many
    people react, but we know immediately to what or who they react and severity of
    the issues.</p><p class="p1">After just 6 months our whole company runs on data,
    we are doing very sophisticated IoT things, using ai across the company and that
    thanks to Keboola. And the best thing ?` We had to only hire one person internally.
    Through the collaborative nature of Keboola’s platform we just hire the smartest
    brains per task.</p><p class="p1">My life got …. With Keboola I can really focus
    on what’s important and that’s our people and actions we take. Keboola takes care
    of the rest. Just imagine during working on the whole process in Keboola we were
    actually able to change several of the key systems like CRM, POS without the whole
    flow breaking. That’s really life changing for CTO and the whole business.</p>
