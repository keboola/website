      data lake, then automatically converts it into managed dwh and materializes
      the JSON on the flie to be instantly ready in relational dwh and ready to be
      queried right away. I don’t have to setup my schemas everytime, it recognizes
      it on the fly! This totally boosts our productivity and allows us to build scalable
      solutions”"
