  author: Jeff Miller, CTO Roti - LinkedIn
  desc: <p>Before we started working with Keboola we had over 20 systems internally
    and externally that we wanted to analyze data for better business decissions and
    take actions based on those insights.</p><p>We had dozens and dozens of xls spreadsheets
    and peopel spent hourse a day to manually retype, clean and report the data. It
    was never on time and never correct. We were not able to move ahead and become
    a technology leader as we had always wanted. Part of the reason was that we new
    from our McDonalds engagement how difficult it is to build an easy enough and
    intuitive infrastructure for all of your needs of integrating, cleaning and analyzing
    data. Even harder when you want the business people to use it and self serve analytics
    and we just didn’t have time and resources to do it. We thought it would take
    us years and millions of dollars to get the results.</p><p><img src="/uploads/quote-img.jpg"></p><p>After
    we engaged with Keboola’s platform we had our first project done in 3 days. All
    the data from user feedback was integrated, stored, cleaned and visualised so
    everybody saw the results immediately. The whole process was orchestrated to happen
    several times a day so we’ve always had fresh data from multiple sources together.</p><p>More
    over, Keboola 3rd party appstore allowed us to apply sofisticated ai techniques
    to our unstructured text with just one click! Now we don’t only se where things
    are happening and how many people react, but we know immediately to what or who
    they react and severity of the issues.</p><p>After just 6 months our whole company
    runs on data, we are doing very sophisticated IoT things, using ai across the
    company and that thanks to Keboola. And the best thing ? We had to only hire one
    person internally. Through the collaborative nature of Keboola’s platform we just
    hire the smartest brains per task.</p><p>My life got …. With Keboola I can really
    focus on what’s important and that’s our people and actions we take. Keboola takes
    care of the rest. Just imagine during working on the whole process in Keboola
    we were actually able to change several of the key systems like CRM, POS without
    the whole flow breaking. That’s really life changing for CTO and the whole business.</p>
