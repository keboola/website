  - title: ACCELERATE DATA PRODUCTION
    colortype: blue
    desc: With one-click scaffolds, you can quickly deploy a fully-fledged data workflow
      to production. No time wasted in discovery, acquiring, organizing, cleaning,
      transforming, and modeling data step by step manually. It also means that no
      time is squandered on project management, communication between departments
      and code hand over.

      process.

      improvement. Scaffolds allow you to swiftly deploy a model that can act as your
      baseline upon which you can develop further. Simplicity without compromise as
      we like to say around here.
