###   
We hope that title didn’t scare you! We wrote these terms and conditions in a way that “normal people” (no offence, lawyers!) can understand, so keep reading!

**Three things we want to highlight:** 

1. Don’t do anything sleazy, illegal, or scammy (yes, we know that’s not a word). If we come across something that looks like that, or get a complaint along those lines, we may close down your account. We have absolute discretion to do so, and this is to keep our platform clean, safe, and respectable. Use Keboola Connection fairly. Don’t try to cheat the system or go behind our backs. Fair use means following the rules, like using one account for one business. If you break the rules, we break your … access. Absolute discretion on that too. We are working our little stripy socks off to keep our services up and running for you around the clock. But we’re not miracle workers. We can’t promise the impossible. If you can’t connect to Keboola Connection, let us know right away at **support@keboola.com**, but please don’t shout at us – we already understand the importance of getting things back up and running. We’re on it.  
    
2. The bottom line is – don’t do anything your mom wouldn’t approve of. If you play nice, we’ll play nice.   
    
3. If you have any questions about all this, please email us at **legal@keboola.com**.

**IMPORTANT:** We kept these terms and conditions pretty simple, but keep in mind that there is a more comprehensive agreement that ultimately governs your use of Keboola Connection - and it prevails over this one to the extent of any conflict. That’s where things like IP ownership (you own your data, we own ours), payments (we invoice, you pay), indemnities (for your protection and ours), and liability limitations (so we don’t have to pay $1million dollars for a hot coffee spill) are all detailed. It’s important, so make sure you’ve read and understood that too. Here’s a [**link**](https://www.keboola.com/master-software-subscription-agreement).
